# Console-Finances

This is a simple JavaScript project for financial analysis. It processes a set of data of financial records to caculate financial metrics. This project was created as part of my learning journey in JavaScript.

## Description

The project analyzes a set of data of financial records, each containing a date and corresponding profit/loss figure. It calculates the following:

- Total number of months
- Net total amount of Profit/Loss.
- Average change in Profit/Loss.
- Greatest increase in Profit/Loss.
- Greatest decrease in Profit/loss.

## Sources

While working for this project I referred to several online resources to understand and learn how to manipulate arrays and objects. Some of the key resources include:

- [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for JavaScript syntax methods.
- [W3Schools] (https://www.w3schools.com/js/) for basic JavaScript tutorials.
